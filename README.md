# pomo-to-do

This repository contains the code for a Pomodoro Timer web application. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break tasks into intervals of 25 minutes, followed by 5 minute breaks. This web app allows users to easily track their study or work sessions and take breaks accordingly. Additionally, I have added a to-do list where users can add each of their tasks they would like to complete during their session, check them off, and delete them. There are 3 different color themes as well!

Languages Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


Features:
- Start a study timer for 25 minutes or start a break timer for 5 minutes.
- Pause and resume the timer as needed.
- Reset the timer to the original values.
- Change the timer display colors between green, blue (default), and purple.
- Create a to-do list with the ability to add and delete items.
- Mark completed tasks by clikcing on them, which adds a strikethrough effect.
- Delete any items (complete or incomplete) by clicking the "X" button.
